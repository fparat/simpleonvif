# simpleonvif

This library provides a simple client for interacting with ONVIF IP cameras.

Inspired by [PyOnvif](https://github.com/Pegax/pyOnvif), the implementation is
simplistic, and focus and basic functions. Use it for prototyping ("make it
work"), but do not expect full compliance of the ONVIF specifications.
